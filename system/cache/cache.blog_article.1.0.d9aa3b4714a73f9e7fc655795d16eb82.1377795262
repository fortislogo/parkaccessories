So much so that the word ‘cottaging’ is commonly used as a verb. The weekends are usually a balance of quiet reflection, jovial cocktail hours by the water followed by simple leisurely dinners of local fresh produce and always some form of competition in the sport or game ‘du jour’, whereby the victor is awarded bragging rights until everyone heads for home. This seems to be the same modus operandi whether you are summering in Muskoka, Lake Placid or Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the resident traditions the atmosphere is always very important for the PARK clan. Wicker baskets and chic canvas totes for ferrying, wooden boats and hand crafted equipment, wool blankets and European eiderdowns for sleeping in the cool nights set the tone. And, of course the proper attire for each activity always elevates the experience and gets everyone in the mood.&lt;/p&gt;
