It has become one of those catch words that society now finds so important for everything or everyone to be ‘authentic’. It is what we all truly aspire to be personally, materially or situationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being authentic cannot be conjured up as we need it and one can usually recognize that ‘je ne sais quoi’ of what it is authentic versus what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adirondacks &amp;nbsp;(PARK’s other headquarters) is unarguably authentic. It has created its own globally recognizable style based on what is truly indigenous and original to the area out of necessity and then improved upon over time in design. The subtleties and richness of something truly authentic cannot be faked and it is these subtleties that PARK doesn’t strive to be but rather simply is out of practicality, design and familial history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend PARK was in the Hamptons. The most memorable thing about the Hamptons is that literally at every turn something beautiful catches your eye, be it a 1965 Aston Martin, a stately house hidden behind an impeccably manicured lawn or all the wonderfully chic little shops and restaurants that line the main streets of each town. &amp;nbsp;These are the most obvious but the real luxury is the barrage of roadside farm stands with their abundantly colorful displays of aesthetically perfect local fruit, vegetables and fresh cut flowers; the symmetrically planted orchards and cornfields and of course the sunsets that are intensely orange and the sun rises that are perfectly pink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is as if even Mother Nature elevates her game for the Hamptons to meet the needs of its pampered residents and help make every moment even more perfect than it already is. PARK could not imagine being one moment in all these beautiful settings without the perfect accessories to be in keeping with its surroundings. &amp;nbsp;After all, who are we to upset Mother Nature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up court side in the front of the quietly understated yet very chic clubhouse, it was great to interact a full day with actual clientele and see a real public reaction to the collection first hand. I was not disappointed to say the least, given the kind accolades and never ending confirmations of both the quality and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly though I met and mingled with many of the lovely members-some of whom were very enthusiastic about the collection and the concept. They were extremely generous in offering advice and really thinking of ideas and opportunities to get PARK out to the world. I think the nature of most people is that they love to help entrepreneurs because it&amp;nbsp;gets their own creativity flowing as well. Having worked in design for many companies over the years we always say that our success is all about the product but I am reminded that it is more about the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision has already begun with silk backed wood veneer from Italy, linen blended ‘faux boix’ fabric from Pierre Frey and a mid-century modern bar fully equipped with Orrefors vintage crystal and Danish martini pitchers. We will be monitoring the progress and look forward to seeing the newly styled VW as Joe ‘PARKS’ his ride’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kind of goes in keeping with when things didn’t always turn out as planned, my mother would say “well, now it is an adventure!”…she still says this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how we should all embrace life, then essentially, real disappointments are replaced with a sort of intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone to live life to the fullest however they see fit, to push the parameters and embrace mishaps which are merely just another journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the ‘joie de vivre’ that is the key. So go sailing in your tux or your grandmother’s tiara… who cares if you get wet after all - water is supposed to be good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Like all beginnings the beginning of summer is no different where all experiences feel new and there is a heightened anticipation of all great things to come. We conjure up images of sunny days and elegantly styled outdoor gatherings, swimming freely in open water and planning the perfect weekend getaways (which always involve some dreamy twilight alfresco dinner). We pine for the first sail, the first tee-off without a sweater, the first early evening tennis game with court-side cocktails…I could go on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitedly and well intentioned, we manage to achieve all these lofty seasonal goals but as summer’s end nears we often realize that we did not make the time for reflection, solitude and meaningful moments with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I look forward to these last weeks to truly try and savor that early evening prosecco and long sunset on the dock both alone and with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Of course only after I’ve swum, kayaked, beaten my opponent at Scrabble and set the perfect table).&lt;/p&gt;

";s:11:"description";s:1006:"&lt;p&gt;Having grown up in Canada summer travel usually involves going to a cottage on a lake as often as possible. So much so that the word ‘cottaging’ is commonly used as a verb. The weekends are usually a balance of quiet reflection, jovial cocktail hours by the water followed by simple leisurely dinners of local fresh produce and always some form of competition in the sport or game ‘du jour’, whereby the victor is awarded bragging rights until everyone heads for home. This seems to be the same modus operandi whether you are summering in Muskoka, Lake Placid or Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the resident traditions the atmosphere is always very important for the PARK clan. Wicker baskets and chic canvas totes for ferrying, wooden boats and hand crafted equipment, wool blankets and European eiderdowns for sleeping in the cool nights set the tone. And, of course the proper attire for each activity always elevates the experience and gets everyone in the mood.&lt;/p&gt;

The love of outdoors, adventure, sports and games is the genesis of what PARK is and how we elevate these experiences is the distinction.&lt;br /&gt;
Putting the extra effort to heighten the aesthetics of all our surroundings be it interior design, entertaining, fashion or moments of solitude are never wasted and often it is the extra effort itself that makes it that much more memorable.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am overwhelmed by the accolades and excitement that both the brand and product have generated and am humbled by all the personal well wishes of family, friends and acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an incredible feeling to finally see a concept that began over 10 years ago come to fruition. Despite the long hours and often endless days there is a sense of calm that is derived from knowing that I will never have to say ‘what if’. This is the spirit of PARK….putting words into action and experiencing not just moments but life to the fullest. CARPE DIEM.&lt;br /&gt;
